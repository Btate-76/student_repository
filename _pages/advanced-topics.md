### Understanding Git and GitHub

In this lesson from <https://programminghistorian.com>, you learn the basics of version control using the example of a simple text or markdown.md document.

- For this you will use [GitHub desktop](https://desktop.github.com){:target="_blank"}, available on both Windows and Mac.
- Recommended (but not essential) is the [Atom Editor](https://atom.io){:target=_"blank"} which  integrates Git operations and synchronization with GitHub.

### Pull Requests

Start by reading this [Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/){:target="_blank"} article on GitHub.

After reading this, you've been introduced to a few new concepts: to *commit* is to update a version in a *branch* of a repository to include any files that you've *staged* (added) for update.

For now, you have only committed in the browser and so staging is not necessary. You've also only committed
to a repository to which you directly *collaborate* (e.g., your private repository has two collaborators: you and your instructor).

*Pull requests* let you tell others about changes you want to *propose* to either a repository you contribute directly as a collaborator, or to one for which you are not a collaborator. In essence, you can request change to be made on a repository and discuss those changes before merging them. For example, If you spot a typo in this document, you can do a *pull request* to offer a fix.

In the video below, you will see this workflow in action.

### Collaborating on GitHub

GitHub on YouTube offers a wealth of training videos. The video below walks through a common situation where you wish to make changes in a document that is not in your repository. This tutorial shows you how to do everything from the browser or GitHub Desktop.

### Git... in a nutshell

If you want a quick peek into Git workflow behind the scenes, for from a commandline perspective, this overview gets you there fast. But don't worry about understanding all of this -- it's just a teaser to give you an idea of what else git can do.
