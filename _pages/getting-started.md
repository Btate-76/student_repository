## Getting Started with your Journal

GitHub is one of the most traffic-ed sites on the Internet with a user base of over 23 million (@2017). Ostensibly, it's a collaborative repository for sharing code. But it's also a site where you can host websites and blogs for free and without any embedded ads.

This site (<{{site.github_owner_url}}>) is hosted by GitHub classroom which:

- provides private repositories for students,
- provides shared repositories for groups of students, and
- enables the instructor to share course materials in a public setting.

If you are new to GitHub, you may feel over-whelmed by strange terminology and an unfamiliar user interface. Fortunately, the knowledge required to work comfortably in this repository is minimal. For this class, you will learn the basics of:

- Making changes to your own repository to include adding, deleting, and modifying documents within the browser
- Editing documents using Markdown
- Engaging in discussions by using 'Issues' within a repository

The private repository created for you under this course is free. When this course ends, you will be able to "fork" (copy) your repository to your own  GitHub account and keep it for as long as you like. As a student (or teacher), you can [sign up for a free student dev pack](https://education.github.com/pack){:target="_blank"} which includes free private repositories for as long as you are a student.

Now work through the following pages so that you will better understand how to work within your repository.

- [GitHub Basics]({{site.url}}/{{site.github_repository_name}}/pages/getting-started/github-basics)
- [GuitHub Markdown]({{site.url}}/{{site.github_repository_name}}/pages/getting-started/markdown-basics)
- [GitHub Issues]({{site.url}}/{{site.github_repository_name}}/pages/getting-started/using-issues)
- [More Advanced Topics]({{site.url}}/{{site.github_repository_name}}/pages/getting-started/advanced-topics)
