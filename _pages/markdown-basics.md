## GitHub Markdown

Markdown is an easy way to format text on GitHub. GitHub recognizes any document with the suffix of '.md' as a markdown document.

The
[markdown help page]({{site.baseurl}}/pages/markdown-help){:target="_blank"} in your repository demonstrates what will work in your repository. Read through the help page and bring up your source view so you can see both. There is a [scratchpad]({{site.baseurl}}/pages/scratchpad/){:target="_blank"} in your [_pages]({{site.repo}}/tree/master/_pages/scratchpad.md){:target="_blank"} directory for you to play with.

In [Practice Assignment]({{site.baseurl}}/2017/07/17/practice-assignment/){:target="_blank"}, the next post in your blog, you get to practice what you've learned.

If you find you are really struggling with markdown,
try using [Prose.io](https://prose.io){:target="_blank"} to edit markdown pages in your repository.

Markdown takes a little practice, but it's really useful once you've mastered it. Since your weekly journal requires markdown, and if you practice, you should be proficient in the basics after a few weeks.
