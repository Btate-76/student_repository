## Using Issues

No doubt, GitHub Issues was originally as a bug tracker. But it turns out that it's a great place to hold conversations on particular topics... much like a discussion board.

Look at this issue tracker for requesting recipes:
<https://github.com/newmerator/recipes/issues>

Note that there are both open and close discussion items; you can comment on either. Play around in here and maybe offer a comment.

One other very important facet of 'issues' is the ability to @mention a person or team in side your issue and comments. When you do this, @mentions are immediately notified. We will try this in class together.

For more information, [check this GitHub guide on Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/){:target="_blank"}.
