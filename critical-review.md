### Example

Look at the notes in [this paper](sauro_lewisCHI2011.pdf), to help guide your thinking. Those annotations in red refer directly to the summary portion of your assignment.

### Rubric

The critique is worth 10 points. It doesn't need to be long -- just answer the questions below. You can use narrative or bullets. I'm not looking for quantity - but evidence of your thinking.

# Critical Review

1. What is the central research question addressed?

<!--
(1 point)

The answer to this question should be in the abstract. It should also be re-iterated somewhere at the beginning of the paper. It will be helpful to find this, since abstracts are dense and you may need more information to fully understand what is meant.

Often experimental studies will have multiple hypotheses and conditions. This is to rule out alternative explanations. It's not possible to conduct a perfect experiment - but authors will try to provide as much evidence as possible to support their claim.

 2. Succinctly summarize:

>  Hypothesis

>  Research design (You will need to refer to the 2nd week class material)

> Conditions & variables

>  Findings

<!--

(1 point each)

I find it helps to take notes while reading. For experiments, it helps to sketch out a table to capture the conditions and variables. In your own words (and succinctly), what are the findings?

3. Critique
<!--5 points. Select and answer five questions from section three above.-->

> Does the paper seem significant or not? Why or why not?

> Does the methodology seem sound or suspect? In what sense?

> Can you think of confounding variables that the author did not discuss?

> Does this paper get its message across clearly? How or how not?

> Does it change your thoughts or has it introduced new ideas to you? In what way?

> Do you think the study is reproduce-able (like an exact recipe) or that the author left out too many details? What do you think needed more explanation?

> Can you imagine how insights from this paper might be used in design?

<!--
Presentation: 5 points total.

Plan on about 10 minutes to include questions. You will probably want a couple of images or charts to help your audience understand the results. Use clear language, even if the authors did not.

- 1 point - Summarize the study (without exhaustive detail). Try to tailor this to your audience. To be a compelling presentation, you want to tell a story. Here are the elements you will want to address:
  - Why was this experimented conducted (rationale)?
  - How was it done (methods)?
  - What was learned (results)?
  - What does it mean (interpretation)?
- 1 point - Include a visual aid(s). It's hard to talk about experiments without some sort of visual.
- 1 point - Mention how this fits to the week's topical reading. This is the opportunity to talk about this paper from a "big picture" perspective.
- 1 point - Share thoughts from your critical review. This is your chance to critique or make observations about what you may have learned.
- 1 point - Answer questions to the best of your ability (but be honest if you don't know the answer. Perhaps, someone else will.)
