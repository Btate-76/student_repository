<strong> Central Research Question: </strong> Will two objects will compete for attention when they are perceptually distinct, as previous research has suggested? What are the differences (& potential reasons) in the time-cost incurred to filter objects that are distinctly separated, versus those that are grouped together?

 <strong>Research Design Method:</strong> Quasi Experimental <br>

<strong>EXPERIMENT 1: READING DELAY W/ SEPARATE OBJECTS </strong> <br>
<strong>Hypothesis A:</strong> Filtering cost happens when an irrelevant object competes for a user’s attention at a distance; thus, taking attention away from the target.
<br>	<em>How this should manifest in this experiment: </em> It takes longer to successfully name the word when the two objects are separate. <br>
<br> <strong>Hypothesis B:</strong>  If filtering cost happens when two objects are interacting with each other (overlapping/shared space aka “Peripheral interference”) the opposite results from Hypothesis A should happen.<br>
<em>	How this should manifest in this experiment: </em> It takes longer to correctly name words inside the shape
<br> <br>
<strong> CONDITIONS:  </strong>
 <ul>
   <li>Displays all contained a single, unique, 4/5 letter word; A fixation point preceded and followed each display; Each display was shown for 200msec </li>
   <li>The Word was either: Presented Alone or With a Colored Shape (rectangle, hexagon, or ellipse). </li>
   <li>	Six conditions were on cards:
    <br>
•	    Word Alone, Above OR Below the fixation point
    <br>
•	Word Opposite Shape, Above OR Below the fixation point
    <br>
    •	Word Within Shape, Above OR Below the fixation point </li>
 <li>Cards were shuffled before each run</li>
 </ul>
 <br> <br>
<strong>	Dependent Variable: </strong>
(1) Accuracy of reading words (2) Latency between seeing display and repeating words <br>
<Strong>Independent Variable: </strong>
<br>Card Type Shown
<br> <br>
<Strong>Findings: </strong>There is a delay in repeating the word when subjects are presented with the competing frame; whether the word is opposite the frame or within the frame. This suggests there is a filtering cost. However, having the word within the frame significantly reduces the filtering cost and causes almost half as many errors as the word being opposite the frame. These findings support Hypothesis A.

<br> <br>

<strong>EXPERIMENT 2: STRATEGY EFFECTS IN FILTERING COST </strong> <br>
<strong>Hypothesis:</strong> Did users in the first experiment use a strategy of checking if the brightly colored object contained a word before putting their attention elsewhere?, thus being a confounding variable for why Word-In-Frame- latency was lower. <br>
<em>“Would reading delay be reduced when subjects knew the word wasn’t in the frame?” </em> <br>
<br><strong>Conditions: </strong>
 <ul>
    <li> 2 Groups of Cards: Word In Frame; with word alone &  Word Opposite frame with Word alone </li>
     <li> ½ of the subjects began with Group 1; the other 1/2  began with Group 2. </li>
     <li> Each group was told how the group of cards would appear before being shown each condition </li>
 </ul> 
 <br>
<strong>	Independent variable: </strong> <br>
o	Group 1 or Group 2 of Cards <br>
	<strong>Dependent variable: </strong> <br> 
o	Latency in reading word <br>
<strong> Results: </strong> There was not delay in reading time when subjects were aware if the word was in frame or not; in fact there was a slightly larger filtering cost than in Experiment one. This suggests strategies did NOT contribute to filtering cost or a mitigating effect of having the stimuli combined. 
<br> <br>

<strong>EXPERIMENT 3: DUAL TASKS AND OBJECT INTERGRALITY </strong> <br>
<strong>Hypothesis A: </strong>  When a Frame and target word are integrated; the frame may be perceived less well than if they were separate objects. This being because allowing for more attention to the word means there’s less available to process the frame (uneven attention competition). <br>
 <strong> Hypothesis: B (The opposite): </strong> Objects compete for attention, but if they are belonging together (i.e grouped); they are processed as one object processed with all of its parts/properties. Both the frame and word may benefit if they are belonging together. <br> 
<br> Conditions: 
  <ul>
 <li> (1) Word Alone (2) Word Opposite Frame or (3) Word Within Frame </li>
  <li> All frames are now the same shape and there is a small gap in either the left or right side </li>
 <li> 	2 tasks: Subjects told to prioritize reading the word BUT ALSO report location of gap </li>
  </li> Random shuffle/presentation of cards; with fixation point before & after; however exposure times varied continuously for each subject to maintain accuracy to ~75% on gap discrimination task </li>
 </ul>
<br> <strong>	Independent variables: </strong> Card Presented 
<br> <strong> Dependent: </strong> (1) Reading latency; (2) accuracy of word reading (3) accuracy of identifying gap location
<br>
<strong> Results: </strong> Although subjects were told reading the word was primary, it wasn’t a always a priority. Reading times were than the previous experiments. However, on the main focal points (reading accuracy and gap identification), the performance of both tasks was worse when the word was opposite the frame instead of within it. This shows that dividing attention between parts/properties of the same object is easier than dividing attention between two separate objects.

Review Questions:
<strong> Does the methodology seem sound or suspect? In what sense?	</strong> 
<br> 
	The methodology seems sound. They began with a broader question, that based on the results lead them towards one, more specific line of thought or the other. After obtaining the results, not only did they analyze them to compare to previous research and the hypothesis, but they also played “devils advocate” by hypothesizing potential confounding variables and then doing subsequent research to either affirm or eliminate those possibilities. 
 <br>
<strong>Can you think of confounding variables that the author did not discuss? </strong>
<br>
	The fixation point may be a confounding variable, although it was intended to help maintain a level of consistency. Researchers performed the second experiment because they were concerned with the use of pre-determined strategy in the subjects’ behavior/results. While the color/shape may not have been the strategy pre-determined, it doesn’t mean one couldn’t have been at play. The shape was centered and the objects (no matter what they were always appeared at a specific distance below or above the shape.) 
It’s not completely infeasible to speculate the subjects eventually determined to begin their search of each display in one of the pre-determined locations, as they would come very familiar with the location on the screen after a few runs. I don’t think this confounding variable is necessarily a flaw in the study design per-say but just a factor that may be considered. Depending on height, a person’s eyes may naturally “rest” in one location (higher or lower) and that determines which area they will consistently begin their search. Perhaps, moving the location of the base fixation point (and therefore the location of the objects) between runs would have helped control for this potential strategy being used.
<br>
<strong> Does it change your thoughts or has it introduced new ideas to you? In what way? </strong>
<br>
	The study introduced the thought that making distinctions may be better by GROUPONG objects together. I feel as though my previous notions on the matter was to make objects distinct by making them stand apart, and therefore grabbing more attention. This study sheds light on the reality that there is a deeper competition for attention at play and that making objects separate may actually make them more likely to compete for attention than to draw it.
 <br>
<strong> Do you think the study is reproduce-able (like an exact recipe) or that the author left out too many details? What do you think needed more explanation </strong>
<br>
	This design is very easily reproducible; they gave highly detailed explanation of all materials used; locations of objects on display and the exposure to them. They had specific criteria from the word choice, to the luminescence, to how the cards were put into groups for use. While the methods of the experiment were very clear cut, the explanation of how their subjects were selected and then put into groups lacks some clarity. 
 <br>
<strong> Can you imagine how insights from this paper might be used in design? </strong>
<br>
 The insights can easily translate into design, in how designers choose to lay out their work in order to draw attention to the most important parts of a piece, without sacrificing attention to another important part.
